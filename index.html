    <p> spastic cerebral palsy is a movment disorder often charaterised by high or low muscule tone, jerky uncontrolled movements , muscle and joint pain and muscule spasams.
    in my case i have; high muscle tone, weak legs , near constant leg pain and muscle spasams (it looks like i am doing the can-can a majorty of the time) and contray to many people's beleifs
    i can't control them despite them telling me to just "tell my legs no." as you can imagine my dear reader's the lack of people understanding leads to immense frustration for example a couple days ago
    an idotic classmate of mine asked if i was trying to kick them (sometime i wish i was actually trying to kick them but then i realise that i wouldn't have enough strength any way. 
    until next time</p>
